      "NormalizationMethod: 'Forecast' is the most common normalization method. It implies creation of a single Model using data from a baseline period (i.e. preconditions). 'Standard Conditions' is used to compare building performance of, say, two particular years to a 'typical' year. In this event, two models are created, one for the baseline and one for the reporting period, and input data is fed into each for a 'typical year' (TMY3, etc.) and performance compared.  'Backcast' is not used often, but makes sense in the event that finer temporal data is available in the reporting period to train the Model. A single Model is also created in this case.\n",

It was shown in Section B4.3 that when measurement errors are negligible, the uncertainty in calculating actual savings using a weather-based regression is due to the error in normalizing the baseline energy use to the postretrofit period. Normalized savings requires two regression equations: one that correlates baseline energy use with baseline weather conditions and one that correlates postretrofit energy use with postretrofit weather conditions.
